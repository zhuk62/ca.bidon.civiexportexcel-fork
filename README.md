CiviCRM export to Excel
=======================

This extension adds the possibility to export directly into the MS Excel
format from CiviReports and Search results, instead of CSV (less fiddling,
easier to use).

This extension uses the PhpSpreadsheet library. See the "License" section below
for more information (LGPL).
